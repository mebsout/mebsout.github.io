  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a collaborative framework for
  reasoning modulo simple properties of non-linear integer
  arithmetic. This framework relies on the AC(X) combination method
  and on interval calculus. The first component is used to handle
  equalities of linear integer arithmetic and associativity and
  commutativity properties of non-linear multiplication. The interval
  calculus component is used --- in addition to standard linear
  operations over inequalities --- to refine bounds of non-linear
  terms and to inform the SAT solver about judicious case-splits on
  bounded intervals. The framework has been implemented in the
  Alt-Ergo theorem prover. We show its effectiveness on a set of
  formulas generated from deductive program verification.}
