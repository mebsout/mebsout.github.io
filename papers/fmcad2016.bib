  abstract = {We present a dual technique for generating and verifying proof
                  certificates in SMT-based model checkers, focusing on
                  proofs of invariant properties. Certificates for two major
                  model checking algorithms are extracted as k-inductive
                  invariants, minimized and then reduced to a formal proof term
                  with the help of an independent proof-producing SMT
                  solver. SMT-based model checkers typically translate input
                  problems into an internal first-order logic
                  representation. In our approach, the correctness of
                  translation from the model checker's input to the internal
                  representation is verified in a lightweight manner by proving
                  the observational equivalence between the results of two
                  independent translations. This second proof is done by the
                  model checker itself and generates in turn its own proof
                  certificate. Our experimental evaluation show that, at the
                  price of minimal instrumentation in the model checker, the
                  approach allows one to efficiently generate and verify proof
                  certificates for non-trivial transition systems and
                  invariance queries.}
