	<h2>Kind 2</h2>

	<p>
	  I'm one of the developpers
	  of <a href="http://kind.cs.uiowa.edu">Kind 2</a>, a multi-engine
	  SMT-based automatic model checker for safety properties of Lustre
	  programs. This tool is developped in collaboration
	  with <a href="">Adrien Champion</a>,
          <a href="http://www.sticksel.info/christoph/">Christoph Sticksel</a>
          and
          <a href="http://cs.uiowa.edu/~tinelli">Cesare Tinelli</a>.

	<p>
	  Kind 2 is an open-source, multi-engine, SMT-based automatic model
	  checker for safety properties of Lustre programs. It takes as input a
	  Lustre file annotated with properties to prove invariant, and outputs
	  for each property either a confirmation or a counterexample, a
	  sequence inputs that falsifies the property.

	<h2>Cubicle</h2>

	<p>
	  I'm one of the developpers
	  of <a href="http://cubicle.lri.fr">Cubicle</a>, an open source
	  model checker for verifying safety properties of array-based
	  systems. This tool is developped in collaboration
	  with <a href="http://www.lri.fr/~conchon/">Sylvain
	    Conchon</a>, <a href="">Amit
	    Goel</a>, <a href="http://www.csee.ogi.edu/~krstics/">Sava

	</p>

	<p>
	  Array-based systems form a syntactically restricted class of
	  parametrized transition systems with states represented 
	  as arrays indexed by an arbitrary number of processes.
	  Cache coherence protocols and mutual exclusion algorithms are
	  typical examples of such systems.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Cubicle model-checks by a symbolic backward reachability
	  analysis on infinite 
	  sets of states represented by specific simple formulas, called cubes.
	  Cubicle is based on ideas introduced
	  by <a href="http://users.mat.unimi.it/users/ghilardi/mcmt/">MCMT</a>
	  from which, in addition to revealing
	  the implementation details, it differs in a more friendly
	  input language and a concurrent architecture.
	  Cubicle is written
	  in <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">OCaml</a>. Its SMT solver
	  is a tightly integrated, lightweight 
	  and enhanced version
	  of <a href="http://alt-ergo.lri.fr">Alt-Ergo</a>; and its
	  parallel implementation relies on 
	  the <a href="http://functory.lri.fr">Functory library</a>.
	  
	</p>


	<p>
	  A particularity of Cubicle is its ability to infer precise
	  and strong invariants through a combination of forward and
	  backward model checking. More on the
	  subject <a href="papers/fmcad2013.pdf">here</a>.

	<h2>Alt-Ergo</h2>

	<p>
	  <a href="http://alt-ergo.lri.fr">Alt-Ergo</a> is an
	  open source automatic theorem prover dedicated to program
	  verification. It belongs the SMT family (Satisfiability
	  Modulo Theories) and is based on CC(X) a congruence closure
	  algorithm parameterized by an equational theory X. It can
	  handle formulas in a polymorphic first order logic. The
	  following theories are currently supported:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Uninterpreted functions (empty theory)</li>
	  <li>Linear arithmetic (integers and reals)</li>
	  <li>Non-linear arithmetic</li>
	  <li>Polymorphic arrays</li>
	  <li>Enumerated datatypes</li>
	  <li>Record datatypes</li>
	  <li>AC (associative commutative) symbols </li>
	  <li>Bitvectors</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	  My contributions to this prover are interval arithmetic,
	  proofs generations (unsat cores, explanations) and
	  models. I'm also particularly involved in the arithmetic
	  part of the prover. This tool is written in OCaml and developped by
	  the <a href="http://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a>,
	  the <a href="http://www.u-psud.fr/">Université Paris-Sud</a>
	  
	  and is distributed under the

	<p>
	  AltGr-Ergo is a graphical frontend to the SMT solver
	  Alt-Ergo written in GTK (with the library
	  <a href="http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/lsl/lablgtk.html">Lablgtk</a>).
	  It displays the AST after typing on which it alows several
	  modifications to be performed:
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>selection of hypotheses and axioms</li>
	  <li>alterations of triggers</li>
	  <li>deletion of (sub-)formulas when the validity remains implied</li>
	  <li>dependencies between logical symbols</li>
	  <li>manual (and possibly partial) instantiation of lemmas
	  and axioms</li>
	  <li>search</li>
	  <li>display warnings (empty triggers)</li>
	  <li>save modifications in a session and attempt to replay
	  them even if the original goal has been modified</li>
	  <li>highlight which hypotheses and axioms were useful to
	  prove the goal</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  AltGr-Ergo also serves a purpose of profiling. It will show
	  what parts and theories of the solver are being stressed
	  when running. It will also report which lemmas are being
	  instantiated (and how much) so as to allow the user to limit
	  certain instantiations in case of divergence.
	</p>

	<p>
	  AltGr-Ergo is distributed with Alt-Ergo.

	<h2>Proof-Manager</h2>


	<p>
	  <em>Proof Manager</em> is a software to manage a base of
	  benchmarks for SMT solvers. Its existence is justified by a
	  certain number of needs in the team which works on
	  Alt-Ergo. Its main objective is to provide a test platform
	  both efficient and easy to use.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <br/>
	  Overview of functionnalities:
	  <br/>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Graphical inteface</li>
	    <li>Allows the execution of provers in parallel (on
	      multi-core and multi-processors marchines)
	    </li>
	    <li>Allows a distributed exection of tasks on a set of
	    machines on the network</li>
	    <li>Distant acces to results and datas</li>
	    <li>Generate execution reports (HTML, CSV) regularly</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Post-processing</h3>
	<p>
	  Results comming from a large number of executions can be
	  processed to be human readable and manipulable by the user
	  through a graphical or text interface. For instance, the user can
	  visualize results from a specific category and even compare
	  them between different executions.
	</p>

	       alt="Exécution distribuée dans Proof Manager"/>
	</a>
	<h3>Parallel and distributed execution</h3>
	<p>
	  The main task performed by <em>Proof Manager</em> is to run
	  a prover on a series of benchmarks. These runs are done in
	  parallel by default if the machine has multiple cores of
	  processors. If the user works in a distributed
	  environnement, he can declare the machines that will be
	  performing the computations and thus take advantage of
	  all the computing power at his disposition.
	</p>

	<h3>Reusability</h3>
	<p>
	  <em>Proof Manager</em> provied a complete command line
	  interface which grant access to all its functions
	  (adding/deleting provers, benchmarks, running tasks, etc.). This
	  interface allows for example to write a simple script that
	  will be executed every night to:
	</p>
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Fetch Alt-Ergo source from a VCS
	  </li>
	  <li>Compile the last version if necessary
	  </li>
	  <li>Register the new prover in the base
	  </li>
	  <li>Run this prover on all benchmarks (or an interesting
	    category such as non-regression tests)
	  </li>
	  <li>Generate an execution report (whith comparisons between
	    previous version of the prover)
	  </li>
	  <li>Upload this HTML report on a web server
	  </li>
	</ol>
